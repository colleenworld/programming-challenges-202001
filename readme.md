# Programming Challenge

These programming challenges are used as a portion of the interview process.

**Note:** This challenge has been forked from the good folks over at Qlik!

**Note:** There are no trick questions, however there are some ways to go above and beyond the strict requirements of the question that can speak to the creativity of the candidate.

## How to Participate

Fork this repository and read the instruction text files in each challenge folder. Complete the challenges, commit and push back to your repository, then open a pull request against this project. We will close the pull request, but it notifies our dev team that someone has taken up the challenge!

## Rules

1. Submissions can be submitted in any language
2. Modify this readme to include a section
on how we can run your code.  This can either be an executable, docker image, a list of instructions, etc... We just need a way to be able to run your code on our computers!
3. 3rd-party vendor libaries can be used if needed

## Good luck!
